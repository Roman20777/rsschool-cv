**Briefly about myself** 
---
In 2005 he graduated from the university with a degree in physics and computer science teacher. At the moment I work as an expert in the field of computer forensics. Additionally, I am engaged in the development of databases in Mysql and the actual maintenance. I know VBA. There is a desire to change the main job and become a programmer.
